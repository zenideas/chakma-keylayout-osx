# Chakma KeyLayout for OSX

Just copy the .keylayout and .icns file into /Library/Keyboard\ Layouts/ on your Mac! 
You probably need to reboot and then you may choose the layout under System Preferences->Keyboard->Input Sources.

After the above change, you'll see the Chakma Layout in the menus like below:
