# Chakma KeyLayout for OSX

Just copy the .keylayout and .icns file into /Library/Keyboard\ Layouts/ on your Mac! 
You probably need to reboot and then you may choose the layout under System Preferences->Keyboard->Input Sources.

### Modify the layout ###

Feel the need to update the layout to your liking by adding in the Chakma language characters? Download the keyboard layout tool [Ukelele][0] and play with it.
